let input = {"plan":{"objective":"Release 1.13.0 of Core Facility Tracker on branch claude/jolly-maxwell-95wu0m in /home/user/Core-Facility-CRM: (1) a reusable booking Tags picker with per-tag usage counts (cancelled included) and search-or-create in both booking dialogs only; (2) one role pill on the person profile coloured by a shared Views.typeBadge helper, 'Facility Staff' added to PERSON_TYPES; (3) training levels renamed Regular / Super User with a fenced, idempotent migration of stored 'User' rows; (4) a #/instrument/<id> Instrument Profile route mirroring the person profile (header + New Booking, utilization tiles from Reports aggregations, details, upcoming 14 days, Recent Activity with User / Date / Start–End / Duration / Assisted / Notes / Status and em-dash fallbacks, trained users, active projects); (5) a full-width Today's Agenda card on the Dashboard; (6) a richer demo dataset (9 more people with real roles, 17 more bookings incl. two today, 7 more training rows) respecting every seed/test invariant; (7) a docs-only extensions/importers concept document linked from ROADMAP.md; (8) a final release task bumping index.html/sw.js/js/consts.js to 1.13.0, converting the CHANGELOG '## [Unreleased]' heading to '## [1.13.0] — 2026-09-17', with docs/index.html highlights and manual updates.","assumptions":["Repo /home/user/Core-Facility-CRM, branch claude/jolly-maxwell-95wu0m. Actual HEAD is 34a3f11 ('chore: CMA planner script for the 1.13.0 run'), one tooling commit on top of a106b75 (1.12.1); every js/, css/, test/ and docs/manual file is identical to a106b75. Executors run `git rev-parse --short HEAD` and `git status --short` first; they may see uncommitted work from earlier tasks of THIS run (tags picker, typeBadge, instrument profile, 1.13 fences) and must build on it, never revert it. core.autocrlf is unset and line endings are LF; never introduce CRLF (wiring.test.js and boot-ready-signal.test.js are LF-anchored source scrapers).","Baseline at HEAD: `TZ=Asia/Jerusalem node --test 'test/unit/*.test.js'` -> 318 pass / 0 fail; `TZ=Asia/Jerusalem node --test 'test/browser/*.spec.js'` -> 65 pass / 0 fail (Playwright + Chromium preinstalled, PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers).

Always pass the test glob, never the directory.

Read-only comparisons only: `git diff`, `git show HEAD:<path> > /tmp/claude-0/.../scratchpad/<name>`.","NO VERSION BUMP in T1-T12: index.html ?v=1.12.1 (8 tags), sw.js CACHE_VERSION + PRECACHE_URLS, js/consts.js APP_VERSION all stay 1.12.1 until T13. CHANGELOG bullets from feature tasks go under a `## [Unreleased]` heading (created by T1 directly above `## [1.12.1] — 2026-09-17`); versions.test.js's heading regex needs digits, so that heading does not break it. T13 converts it to `## [1.13.0] — 2026-09-17`.","CLAUDE.md invariants apply to every task and are restated in scope where relevant: dates are local calendar days (UI.ymd / UI.today / UI.todayPlusDays, never toISOString().slice(0,10) - wiring.test.js lints this); selectable = not retired OR already selected; denormalized meetings.attendees is only ever written together with meeting_people (seed uses seedBooking({peopleIds})); explicit child-row deletes in delete paths; Title Case for controls/column headings, sentence case for prose/hints/empty states; danger confirm dialogs keep the red Cancel; aggregation figures come from js/reports.js compute* functions, never re-derived; every literal data-act=\"x\" needs a `case 'x':` inside handleAct's switch and vice versa (wiring.test.js scrapes both directions - so picker option buttons must NOT use data-act); every ic('name') must be a key of ui.js ICONS (home folder users user cpu calendar settings gear plus check check-circle alert x file file-plus sparkles rocket layers compass trash target play chevron chevron-left chevron-right sun moon edit search filter external tag clock eye collapse expand copy mail archive book); js/app.js never reads document.querySelector('.modal') (use UI.topModal()).","Reports API as it exists: `Reports.makeFacts(from, to)` returns a facts bundle bound to that range; `Reports.computeInstrumentRows(from, to, facts)` (three arguments, not one) returns `{ rows, totalHours }` with rows `{ id, name, retired, bookings, hours, revenue, sharePct }` where bookings/hours exclude every cancelled booking and revenue follows the Project Costs rule. It has NO distinct-users figure, so the instrument profile's Distinct Users tile is one small direct query (COUNT(DISTINCT meeting_people.person_id) over this instrument's non-cancelled bookings in range) and is documented as such in the code comment.","Demo seed facts at HEAD (js/db.js seedSampleData): 8 people (ids 1-8; 6,7,8 are Facility Staff), 5 instruments (1 Leica SP8, 2 Olympus FV3000, 3 Zeiss Lightsheet, 4 Nikon AX R, 5 Glacios Cryo-TEM), 3 projects, 3 grants, 14 seedBooking calls (booking #1 'Project Kickoff & Laser Alignment Review' is the lowest meeting id and must keep 490 / 546.25 / 589.95), 9 training rows (exactly one NULL trained_on), exactly one 'workshop' booking, tags in use: STED, Fiji, Napari, Lightsheet, Grant Planning, Workshop.

IMPORTANT: All file operations MUST be inside this repository. Use absolute paths under it. Do not touch files elsewhere.

BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE: read ${repoPath}/docs/cma-lessons.md if it exists — it carries this repo's hard invariants (things that broke production before) and the practices that made past tasks pass verification first-try. Apply it.

Scope: ${task.scope}
Verification criteria (you must satisfy this): ${task.verification}
${priorFeedback ? `\nA previous attempt FAILED verification. Fix exactly these problems:\n${priorFeedback}\n` : ''}
Rules:
- Make only the changes this one task requires. Do not start other tasks.
- Reuse existing code/utilities where possible.
- After editing, run the smallest command that exercises your change (from within ${repoPath}).
- If you cannot complete it, set outcome "blocked" and explain the exact missing piece.

BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE: read ${repoPath}/docs/cma-lessons.md if it exists — its lessons name the failure modes worth hunting (repo invariants that static checks miss) and the verification styles that caught real defects (concrete adversarial traces, truth tables, byte-identical regression diffs, runtime harnesses for arithmetic).

- changes: ${exec ? JSON.stringify(exec.changes) : '[]'}

Do NOT trust that report. Independently inspect the actual files under ${repoPath} and run the relevant check yourself. Set pass=false if the criteria are not genuinely met, if files are missing/wrong, or if you are uncertain.

Report via the structured output. Your StructuredOutput call MUST include ALL FIVE fields in one object — omitting any of them is a schema error that wastes a retry:

- pass (boolean)
